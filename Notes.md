### Shell Settings

Bourne-Again and Z Shell configuration files should be placed within the user's home (~) directory. The Zsh configurations are separated into modules, which can be found in the .zshrc_components directory. This should also be placed into the user's home directory.

### Vim Settings

This is still a work in progress. Some vim config should be refactored into a package manager like vundle or pathogen.

### iTerm2 Profile

To export iTerm2 preferences, navigate to Preferences > Profiles.

Look for the 'Other Actions' dropdown menu, and click on that. 'Copy Profile as Json' will copy the selected profile's configurations into the clipboard.
