# Installation

To add the fairyfloss theme to VS Code, move to the extensions folder, and add
a symbolic link pointing to the fairyfloss directory. This can be done by
running the following commands:

```sh
cd ~/.vscode/extensions/
ln -s ~/path/to/fairyfloss/
```

If you would like to remove the symbolic link later, you can use the 'unlink'
command.
