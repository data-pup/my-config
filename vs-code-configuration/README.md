# Installation

## Themes

To add the themes to VS Code, move to the extensions folder, and add
a symbolic link pointing to the fairyfloss directory. This can be done by
running the following commands:

```sh
cd ~/.vscode/extensions/
ln -s ~/path/to/theme/
```

If you would like to remove the symbolic link later, you can use the 'unlink'
command.

## Settings

The settings.json file in this directory contains the main config settings.
The other files can have their contents copy+pasted into the settings file
as you like, to match the workbench theme to the current editor theme.
